        <h1>ORIGINAL COMPUTER
</h1>
        <p>Since the introduction of the first digital electronic calculator (ENIAC), the development of computers can be classified into five generations. In the first generation (1945-1956), Professor Mauchly and his pupil Eckert at the University of Pennsylvania have designed since 1943 and launched in 1946 a giant computer with a volume of 20 meters, It is 2.8 meters wide and several meters wide, capable of performing up to 5,000 extra operations per second. After several years, computers were popularized in universities, government agencies, banks and insurance companies..</p>

        </p>In the late 1970s, technology began to grow and prices were falling so many American families knew of the device. Computers before 1981 are as bulky as big barrels. Wives use it to store recipes and husbands view it as a tool for family finances. Kids do homework on computers and play some simple games. Famous computer lines of the day: Commodore PET, Atari 400, Tandy Radio Shack TRS-80 and Apple II..</p>
        <p>The 1990s
Major brands such as Amiga, Commodore, Atari, Sinclair and Amstrad have to "fight" in a fierce market, forcing prices down to compete. The names that later became known as Compaq and Dell, are known as the emerging names in the Windows platform market. The launch of Windows 3.0 and then Windows 95, Windows 98 helped Microsoft confirm its name in the computer market. While Apple has had success with the PowerBook, Microsoft is still the dominant player in the PC market.</p>

2000s
The Y2K incident caused the computer time format to be inverted, but the consequences were not as severe as expected. This time, the Internet also looks at the formidable growth.
Apple released Mac OS X in 2002, followed by PowerBooks, iBooks, iMacs, Mac Minis, and MacBook Air running on the operating system. Next, the Window XP operating system is also a successful software product

        <h1>The Year 200 problem</h1>
        <p>The Year 2000 problem, also known as the Y2K problem, the Millennium bug, the Y2K bug, or Y2K, is a class of computer bugs related to the formatting and storage of calendar data for dates beginning in the year 2000. Problems were anticipated, and arose, because many programs represented four-digit years with only the final two digits â€” making the year 2000 indistinguishable from 1900. The assumption of a twentieth-century date in such programs could cause various errors, such as the incorrect display of dates and the inaccurate ordering of automated dated records or real-time events.

In 1997 the British Standards Institute (BSI) developed standard DISC PD2000-1[1] defining "Year 2000 Conformity requirements" as four rules: (1) No valid date will cause any interruption in operations; (2) Calculation of durations between, or the sequence of, pairs of dates will be correct whether any dates are in different centuries; (3) In all interfaces and in all storage, the century must be unambiguous, either specified, or calculable by algorithm; (4) Year 2000 must be recognised as a leap year.

It identifies two problems that may exist in many computer programs. First, the practice of representing the year with two digits became problematic with logical error(s) arising upon "rollover" from xx99 to xx00. This had caused some date-related processing to operate incorrectly for dates and times on and after 1 January 2000, and on other critical dates which were billed "event horizons". Without corrective action, long-working systems would break down when the "... 97, 98, 99, 00 ..." ascending numbering assumption suddenly became invalid.

Secondly, some programmers had misunderstood the Gregorian calendar rule that determines whether years that are exactly divisible by 100 are not leap years, and assumed the year 2000 would not be a leap year. Years divisible by 100 are not leap years, except for years that are divisible by 400. Thus the year 2000 was a leap year.

Companies and organisations worldwide checked, fixed, and upgraded their computer systems to address the anticipated problem.[2]

Very few computer failures were reported when the clocks rolled over into 2000. It is not known how many problems went unrecorded
